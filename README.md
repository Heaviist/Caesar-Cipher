# Caesar-Cipher
The Odin Project≈õ Caesar Cipher in ruby

# Assignment
Create a Caesar Cipher in ruby

# Goal
Have a working running Caesar Cipher

# Expectations
Not sure what to expect of this assigment. Ruby feels like I can do a lot with it but how and if I can write it efficiently is still somewhere up there. It will be interesting to see how concise this project will be. I'm planning to not work too much on writing short, efficient and concise, as I just want to get a better feel for the language with this assignment.

# Results and Evaluation
Seemingly with the knowledge of the JavaScript course before, this was relatively straightforward. Mostly because it was obvious where to find the info for the conversions. Finding ruby methods online is easy as well. I feel like the if statement might be written shorter in ruby, as that's what it seems to be good at, but overall pretty happy with the results.
