# Caesar-Cipher
The Odin Project≈õ Caesar Cipher in ruby

# Assignment
Create a Caesar Cipher in ruby

# Goal
Have a working running Caesar Cipher

# Expectations
Not sure what to expect of this assigment. Ruby feels like I can do a lot with it but how and if I can write it efficiently is still somewhere up there. It will be interesting to see how concise this project will be. I'm planning to not work too much on writing short, efficient and concise, as I just want to get a better feel for the language with this assignment.
